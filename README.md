### Hi there 👋

<!--
**cyrilmarceau/cyrilmarceau** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on web application in python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, Django REST framework and Bash script
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on [Fig](fig.io)
